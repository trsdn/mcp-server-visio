# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of VisioMcp with security updates:

| Version | Supported          | Status |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| 1.7.x   | :white_check_mark: | Active |
| 1.6.x   | :white_check_mark: | Active |
| < 1.6   | :x:                | Unsupported |

## Security Features

VisioMcp includes several security measures:

### Input Validation

- **Path Traversal Protection**: All file paths are validated with `Path.GetFullPath()`
- **File Size Limits**: 1GB maximum file size to prevent DoS attacks
- **Extension Validation**: Only `.vsdx` and `.vsdm` files are accepted
- **Path Length Validation**: Maximum 32,767 characters (Windows limit)

### Code Analysis

- **Enhanced Security Rules**: CA2100, CA3003, CA3006, CA5389, CA5390, CA5394 enforced as errors
- **Treat Warnings as Errors**: All code quality issues must be resolved
- **CodeQL Scanning**: Automated security scanning on every push

### COM Security

- **Controlled Visio Automation**: Visio.Application runs with `Visible=false` and `DisplayAlerts=false`
- **Resource Cleanup**: Comprehensive COM object disposal and garbage collection
- **No Remote Connections**: Only local Visio automation supported

### VisioMcp Service Security

The VisioMcp Service manages Visio COM automation sessions:

**MCP Server**: The service runs fully **in-process** — no inter-process communication. There is no attack surface beyond the MCP Server process itself.

**CLI**: The CLI daemon uses a **Windows named pipe** (`VisioMcp-cli-{USER_SID}`) for communication between CLI commands and the daemon process:

| Protection | Status | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **User Isolation** | ✅ Enforced | Pipe name includes user SID. Users cannot access each other's daemon. |
| **Windows ACLs** | ✅ Enforced | Named pipe restricts access to current user's SID via `PipeSecurity` ACLs. |
| **Local Only** | ✅ Enforced | Named pipes are local IPC only - no network access possible. |
| **Process Restriction** | ❌ Not Enforced | Any process running as the same user can connect to the CLI daemon. |

**What This Means:**

1. **Same-user access**: Any application running under your Windows user account can connect to the CLI daemon and execute Visio operations. This is by design, similar to how Docker and database servers work.

2. **No cross-user access**: User A cannot connect to User B's CLI daemon. Each user has a separate named pipe with their SID.

3. **No network access**: The named pipe is strictly local. Remote processes cannot connect.

**Security Implications:**

- If malware runs under your user account, it could theoretically connect to the CLI daemon and control Visio
- However, such malware could already control Visio directly (or do anything else you can do)
- The service does not elevate privileges or provide capabilities beyond what the user already has

### Dependency Management

- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates and security patches
- **Dependency Review**: Pull request scanning for vulnerable dependencies
- **Central Package Management**: Consistent versioning across all projects

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** Create a Public Issue

Please do not create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. This could put all users at risk.

### 2. Report Privately

Report security vulnerabilities using one of these methods:

**Preferred Method: GitHub Security Advisories**

1. Go to <https://github.com/trsdn/mcp-server-visio/security/advisories>
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the advisory form with detailed information

**Alternative: GitHub Direct Message**

Contact the maintainer via GitHub: [@trsdn](https://github.com/trsdn)

Subject: `[SECURITY] VisioMcp Vulnerability Report`

### 3. Information to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What could an attacker do with this vulnerability?
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected?
- **Proof of Concept**: Steps to reproduce (if possible)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have a fix or mitigation (optional)

Example:

```
Vulnerability: Path traversal in file operations
Impact: Attacker could read/write files outside intended directory
Affected Versions: 1.0.0 - 1.0.2
PoC: VisioMcp.exe pq-export "../../../etc/passwd" "query"
Suggested Fix: Validate resolved paths are within allowed directories
```

### 4. What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: Regular updates on progress
- **Fix Timeline**:
  - Critical: 7 days
  - High: 30 days
  - Medium: 90 days
  - Low: Best effort

### 5. Coordinated Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Fix**: We'll develop a fix privately
2. **Security Advisory**: Create GitHub Security Advisory
3. **CVE Assignment**: Request CVE if applicable
4. **Public Release**: Release patch with security notes
5. **Credit**: We'll credit you in the release notes (if desired)

## Security Best Practices for Users

### MCP Server Security

- **Validate AI Requests**: Review Visio operations requested by AI assistants
- **File Path Restrictions**: Only allow MCP Server access to specific directories
- **Audit Logs**: Monitor MCP Server operations in logs
- **Trust Configuration**: Only enable VBA trust when necessary

### CLI Security

- **Script Validation**: Review automation scripts before execution
- **File Permissions**: Ensure Visio files have appropriate permissions
- **Isolated Environment**: Run in sandboxed environment when processing untrusted files
- **Visio Security Settings**: Maintain appropriate Visio macro security settings

### Development Security

- **Code Review**: All changes require review before merge
- **Branch Protection**: Main branch protected with required checks
- **Signed Commits**: Consider using signed commits (recommended)
- **Least Privilege**: Run with minimal required permissions

## Known Security Considerations

### Visio COM Automation

- **Local Only**: VisioMcp only supports local Visio automation
- **Windows Only**: Requires Windows with Visio installed
- **Visio Process**: Creates Visio.Application COM objects
- **Macro Security**: VBA operations require user consent via `setup-vba-trust`

### File System Access

- **Full Path Resolution**: All paths resolved to absolute paths
- **No Network Paths**: UNC paths and network drives not supported
- **Current User Context**: Operations run with current user permissions

### AI Integration (MCP Server)

- **Trusted AI Assistants**: Only use with trusted AI platforms
- **Request Validation**: Review operations before Visio executes them
- **Sensitive Data**: Avoid exposing presentations with sensitive data to AI assistants
- **Audit Trail**: MCP Server logs all operations
