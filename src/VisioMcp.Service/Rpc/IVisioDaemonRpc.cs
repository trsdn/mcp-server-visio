/// Typed RPC interface for CLI↔daemon communication over named pipes.

///
/// The interface has a single method that delegates to <see cref="VisioMcpService.ProcessAsync"/>,
/// preserving the existing command routing while gaining:
/// - Proper error propagation (JSON-RPC error objects instead of swallowed exceptions)
/// - Standard protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0 with Content-Length framing)
/// - Type safety (compile-time contract between client and server)
/// - Testability via <c>Nerdbank.FullDuplexStream.CreatePair()</c>
