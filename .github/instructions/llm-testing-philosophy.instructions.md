# LLM Testing Philosophy

> **⚠️ CORE PRINCIPLE: Tests simulate real users. Failures expose product gaps, not test gaps.**

## What Are LLM Tests?

LLM tests use an AI coding agent (with its own default system prompt) to exercise our CLI and MCP tools. The agent receives a **natural language prompt** — the same kind a real user would type — and must figure out how to accomplish the task using our tools.

These tests do NOT test the LLM. They test **our product's usability surface**:
- Skill documentation (SKILL.md)
- CLI `--help` output
- MCP tool descriptions (XML `/// <summary>`)
- Error messages and recovery hints
- Parameter naming and discoverability
- Workflow coherence

## The Golden Rule

> **If the LLM can't figure it out, fix the product — never fix the test.**

When an LLM test fails, the root cause is ALWAYS one of:
1. Our **skill docs** don't explain the workflow clearly enough
2. Our **tool descriptions** are misleading or incomplete
3. Our **CLI --help** output doesn't show the right examples
4. Our **error messages** don't guide recovery
5. Our **parameter names** are confusing or undiscoverable
6. The test itself is unreasonable (rare — only fix if a human couldn't do it either)

## What NEVER Belongs in a Test

### ❌ xfail or skip Markers

**NEVER use `@pytest.mark.xfail` or `@pytest.mark.skip` to hide failing tests.**

Tests either **pass or fail**. There is no middle ground.

- `xfail` masks real failures and creates a false sense of progress
- `skip` hides broken code instead of fixing it
- If a test fails, **fix the product** — the test is exposing a real problem (Golden Rule)
- If a test is flaky, fix the flakiness — don't paper over it with xfail

### ❌ CLI Command Guidance in Prompts

A real user doesn't know our CLI syntax. Neither should the test prompt.

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Teaching the LLM how to use our CLI
prompt = """
Create a slide layout then set it to use a custom master using 
'visiocli slidemaster' (run --help to see options).
The custom layout uses layout-type value 0.
"""

# ✅ CORRECT: Natural user request
prompt = """
Create a presentation with a custom slide layout showing
title and content areas.
"""
```

### ❌ Tool-Specific Hints in Prompts

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Directing the LLM to a specific command
prompt = """
Use the 'visiocli chartconfig' command to change the chart title.
"""

# ✅ CORRECT: What the user wants
prompt = """
Change the chart title to "Q1 Sales Report" without 
deleting and recreating the chart.
"""
```

### ❌ System Prompt Engineering

The system prompt belongs to the agent, not to us. We don't control what system prompt VS Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, or any other host uses.

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Adding our own guidance to the system prompt
agent = Agent(
    system_prompt=(
        "Run 'visiocli <command> --help' when unsure about parameter names\n"
        "Always use -q flag for clean JSON output"
    ),
)

# ✅ CORRECT: No system prompt (use skill only) or minimal role context
agent = Agent(
    skill=ppt_cli_skill,  # Our product — this IS the right place for guidance
)
```

### ❌ Session Recovery Instructions

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Teaching the LLM our session model
prompt = """
IMPORTANT: First, run 'visiocli session list' to confirm 
which file is open, then use that file path.
"""

# ✅ CORRECT: If session discovery is hard, fix the product:
# - Better error messages: "No active session. Run 'visiocli session list' to see open files."
# - Better skill docs: Add "Session Management" section with recovery patterns
# - Better --help: Show session workflow in command help
```

## What DOES Belong in a Test

### Natural Language Prompts

Write prompts as a knowledgeable PowerPoint user would. They know PowerPoint concepts but NOT our specific CLI/MCP tool syntax.

```python
prompt = f"""
Create a new PowerPoint file at {unique_path('sales-presentation')}

Add a title slide with:
Title: "Q1 Sales Report"
Subtitle: "Regional Performance Summary"

Add a second slide with a table:
Region, Product, Sales
North, Widget, 15000
South, Gadget, 12000

Add a chart on the third slide showing Region vs Sales.

Save and close the file.
"""
```

### Reasonable Assertions

Assert on **outcomes** the user cares about, not implementation details:

```python
# ✅ Good: Did the operation succeed?
assert result.success
assert_cli_exit_codes(result)

# ✅ Good: Did the LLM report key results?
assert_regex(result.final_response, r"(?i)(slide|shape|title)")

# ⚠️ Fragile: Exact numeric values across 5 conversation turns
assert_regex(result.final_response, r"\$?43,500\.00")  # Requires perfect execution of ALL prior steps
```

### Appropriate Complexity

Match test complexity to what a real user would attempt in one conversation:

| Complexity | Turns | Example |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Simple | 1 | Create file → add slides → read back → close |
| Medium | 1-2 | Create file → add content → add chart → save |
| Complex | 2-3 | Build presentation → add animations → configure transitions |
| Unreasonable | 5+ | 13-step workflow with exact numeric assertions on final state |

## Where to Fix Failures

When a test fails, investigate in this order:

### 1. Skill Documentation (`skills/visio-cli/SKILL.md`, `skills/visio-mcp/SKILL.md`)

The skill IS our product's interface to LLMs. If the LLM doesn't know how to:
- Add a shape to a slide → Add workflow patterns to the skill
- Use `--values-file` instead of `--values` → Document when to use file params
- Discover `chartconfig` commands → Add chart modification patterns

```markdown
## Chart Modification Patterns
To change chart properties WITHOUT deleting the chart:
- Title: `chartconfig set-title`
- Type: `chartconfig set-type`
```

### 2. CLI `--help` Output

The `--help` text is what the LLM sees when it runs `visiocli <command> --help`. If a parameter is hard to discover, improve the help text.

Look at:
- `[Description]` attributes on Settings properties
- Parameter ordering and grouping
- Whether common workflows are clear from help alone

### 3. MCP Tool Descriptions and Skill References

For MCP tests, the tool description IS the API documentation. If the LLM picks wrong tools or wrong parameters, improve the XML docs.

For detailed guidance (workflows, quirks, best practices), update `skills/shared/*.md`. These are **auto-synced** to MCP prompts at build time — Claude Desktop and skill-based clients get identical guidance.

### 4. Error Messages

When a CLI command fails, does the error message tell the LLM how to fix it? 

```
# ❌ Bad error message
"Parameter 'mCode' is required"

# ✅ Good error message  
"Parameter 'mCode' is required for 'create' action. Provide --m-code with inline M code or --m-code-file with a file path."
```

### 5. Parameter Naming

If the LLM consistently gets a parameter name wrong, the name might be confusing. Consider renaming or adding aliases.

## Test Structure Conventions

### Agent Configuration

```python
agent = Agent(
    name="descriptive-test-name",
    provider=Provider(model=f"azure/{DEFAULT_MODEL}", rpm=DEFAULT_RPM, tpm=DEFAULT_TPM),
    cli_servers=[ppt_cli_server],   # CLI tests
    # OR
    mcp_servers=[visio_mcp_server],   # MCP tests
    skill=ppt_cli_skill,            # Our product documentation
    max_turns=DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS,      # Always set explicitly
)
```

- **Always set `max_turns`** explicitly — relying on defaults creates silent failures
- **No custom `system_prompt`** unless testing a specific user persona (rare)
- **Always include `skill`** — this is our product's documentation

### Multi-Turn Tests

Each turn should be a natural continuation of the conversation:

```python
# Turn 1: Set up
result = await aitest_run(agent, "Create file and enter data...")
messages = result.messages

# Turn 2: Analyze (natural continuation)
result = await aitest_run(agent, "Now add a chart to the third slide from that data...", messages=messages)
```

Keep multi-turn tests to **2-3 turns maximum**. If you need 5 turns, the test is testing too many features at once — split it into separate tests.

## MCP/CLI Test Sync Rule (CRITICAL)

**Every test scenario MUST exist for BOTH CLI and MCP.** The two entry points are equal citizens — if a scenario is worth testing for one, it's worth testing for the other.

### Current Test Mapping

| Test Scenario | CLI File | MCP File |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| calculation_mode | `test_cli_calculation_mode.py` | `test_mcp_calculation_mode.py` |
| chart | `test_cli_chart.py` | `test_mcp_chart.py` |
| chart_positioning | `test_cli_chart_positioning.py` | `test_mcp_chart_positioning.py` |
| file_slide | `test_cli_file_slide.py` | `test_mcp_file_slide.py` |
| financial_report_automation | `test_cli_financial_report_automation.py` | `test_mcp_financial_report_automation.py` |
| modification_patterns | `test_cli_modification_patterns.py` | `test_mcp_modification_patterns.py` |
| slide_layout | `test_cli_slide_layout.py` | `test_mcp_slide_layout.py` |
| shape_operations | `test_cli_shape_operations.py` | `test_mcp_shape_operations.py` |
| range | `test_cli_range.py` | `test_mcp_range.py` |
| sales_report_workflow | `test_cli_sales_report_workflow.py` | `test_mcp_sales_report_workflow.py` |
| animation | `test_cli_animation.py` | `test_mcp_animation.py` |
| table | `test_cli_table.py` | `test_mcp_table.py` |

### Rules for Creating / Updating / Deleting Tests

1. **Creating a new test:** ALWAYS create BOTH the CLI and MCP version. Name them identically except for the prefix (`test_cli_` vs `test_mcp_`). The prompt text should be identical — only the agent configuration differs (cli_servers vs mcp_servers, cli skill vs mcp skill).

2. **Updating a test:** Update BOTH the CLI and MCP version. If you change the prompt or assertions in one, apply the same change to the other. The test scenario must remain equivalent.

3. **Deleting a test:** Delete BOTH versions. Never leave an orphaned test in only one entry point.

4. **Test parity check:** Before committing, verify that `llm-tests/cli/` and `llm-tests/mcp_tests/` have matching test files (same scenarios, same count minus the prefix).

### Agent Configuration Differences

The ONLY differences between CLI and MCP versions of a test should be:

```python
# CLI version
agent = Agent(
    name="test-name-cli",
    cli_servers=[ppt_cli_server],
    skill=ppt_cli_skill,
    ...
)

# MCP version
agent = Agent(
    name="test-name-mcp",
    mcp_servers=[visio_mcp_server],
    skill=visio_mcp_skill,
    ...
)
```

Prompts, assertions, and test logic should be **identical**.

## SKILL.md and MCP Prompt Generation Awareness (CRITICAL)

**SKILL.md files and MCP skill prompts are auto-generated. Never edit them directly.**

### Generation Pipelines

**SKILL.md (for skill-based clients like VS Code, Cursor):**
```
C# Interfaces (XML /// docs)
  → Roslyn Source Generator (ServiceRegistryGenerator)
    → _SkillManifest.g.cs (JSON const)
      → MSBuild Task (GenerateSkillFile.cs)
        → Scriban Templates (.sbn)
          → Generated SKILL.md
```

**MCP Skill Prompts (for Claude Desktop and MCP-only clients):**
```
skills/shared/*.md (source of truth)
  → MSBuild EmbeddedResource with Link (embedded in assembly)
  → MSBuild GenerateSkillPromptsClass inline task
    → PptSkillPrompts.g.cs (14 [McpServerPrompt] methods)
      → Claude Desktop sees identical guidance as skill clients
```

### Where to Fix What

| Problem | Fix Location | NOT Here |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Wrong tool/command description | `I*Commands.cs` XML `/// <summary>` | `SKILL.md` |
| Wrong parameter docs | `I*Commands.cs` XML `/// <param>` | `SKILL.md` |
| Wrong skill prose/rules/workflows | `skills/templates/SKILL.cli.sbn` or `SKILL.mcp.sbn` | `SKILL.md` |
| Wrong reference doc content | `skills/shared/*.md` | `skills/ppt-*/references/*.md` |
| Wrong MCP prompt content | `skills/shared/*.md` | `Prompts/Content/Skills/` |
| Wrong Tool Selection table (MCP) | `skills/templates/SKILL.mcp.sbn` | `SKILL.md` |
| New skill reference needed | Add `.md` to `skills/shared/` + description in `.csproj` | Don't create separate prompt |

### Key Files

- **Templates:** `skills/templates/SKILL.cli.sbn`, `skills/templates/SKILL.mcp.sbn`
- **Reference docs (source of truth):** `skills/shared/*.md` → auto-synced to BOTH skill refs AND MCP prompts
- **Generated files (NEVER edit):** `skills/visio-cli/SKILL.md`, `skills/visio-mcp/SKILL.md`, `obj/.../PptSkillPrompts.g.cs`
- **Description overrides:** `src/VisioMcp.McpServer/VisioMcp.McpServer.csproj` → `GenerateSkillPromptsClass` task
- **Build command:** `dotnet build -c Release` regenerates SKILL.md, copies references, and generates prompt class

### Testing Impact

When a test fails because the LLM misuses a tool or parameter:
1. Check the SKILL template (`skills/templates/SKILL.*.sbn`) — is the guidance correct?
2. Check the reference doc (`skills/shared/*.md`) — are the parameter values correct?
3. Check the C# interface XML docs — is the tool description accurate?
4. Fix in the source file, rebuild (`dotnet build -c Release`), then re-run tests.

**Never fix a SKILL.md directly** — the fix will be lost on next build.

## Quick Checklist

Before submitting an LLM test PR:

- [ ] Prompts read like natural user requests, not CLI tutorials
- [ ] No CLI command names, flag names, or syntax in prompts
- [ ] No system prompt (or minimal role-setting only)
- [ ] `max_turns` set explicitly on Agent
- [ ] Assertions check outcomes, not implementation details
- [ ] At most 2-3 conversation turns
- [ ] If a test needs "hints" to pass, the hint belongs in the skill/help/tool docs instead
- [ ] **BOTH CLI and MCP versions of the test exist** (sync rule)
- [ ] **No direct edits to generated SKILL.md files** (template awareness)
