# MCP LLM Guidance Creation Guide

> **How to create effective guidance for LLMs consuming the MCP server**

## Core Principle

**Write FOR expert LLMs (GitHub Copilot, Claude), not ABOUT the system.**

LLMs already know PowerPoint, JSON, and MCP protocol. They need server-specific patterns only.

## What to Include

**1. Action Catalog:**
- Complete list of valid action values
- Example: "Actions: get-values, set-values, clear-all"

**2. Action Disambiguation:**
- When to use each action
- Example: "clear-all removes formatting, clear-contents preserves it"

**3. Tool Selection:**
- When to use this tool vs other tools
- Example: "Use shape for content, slide for lifecycle"

**4. Server-Specific Behavior:**
- Quirks of THIS implementation
- Example: "Single cell returns [[value]] (2D array), not scalar"
- Example: "For named ranges, use sheetName='' (empty string)"

**5. Common Mistakes:**
- Pitfalls specific to this server
- Example: "Don't forget batch mode for multiple operations"

**6. Parameter Value Examples:**
- Actual values for string parameters
- Example: rangeAddress can be "A1", "A1:C10", or "SalesData"

## What to Exclude

**❌ DON'T explain:**
- PowerPoint concepts (slides, shapes, animations)
- JSON syntax
- Programming basics (arrays, null, types)
- MCP protocol syntax
- Parameter types/requirements (schema provides)

## Prompt File Structure

```markdown
## [Tool Name] Tool

**Actions**: [comma-separated list]

**When to use [tool_name]**:
- [Scenario 1]
- Use [other_tool] for [different scenario]

**Server-specific behavior**:
- [Quirk 1]
- [Quirk 2]

**Action guide**:
- [action-name]: [What makes this different]
- [action-name]: [When to choose this]

**Common mistakes**:
- [Mistake 1 specific to this server]
```

## Length Guidelines

- ✅ One markdown file per tool
- ✅ 50-150 lines total per tool
- ✅ Focus on disambiguation, not explanation
- ❌ Don't write PowerPoint tutorials
- ❌ Don't explain JSON syntax

## Format Guidelines

**All MCP prompts are auto-generated from `skills/shared/*.md`:**
- Source of truth: `skills/shared/*.md` — edit these files
- Auto-embedded and auto-generated `PptSkillPrompts.g.cs` at build time
- NEVER create hand-crafted prompt files — add `.md` to `skills/shared/` instead
- To add a new prompt: add `.md` to `skills/shared/`, add description override in `GenerateSkillPromptsClass` task in `McpServer.csproj`, rebuild

**Writing style:**
- Bullet points over paragraphs
- Action-oriented ("Use X for Y")
- Comparative ("X vs Y: choose X when...")
- Example values in quotes ("A1", "SalesData")

**What to emphasize:**
- ⭐ Action catalog (most important)
- ⭐ Tool selection (when to use this vs others)
- ⭐ Server quirks (non-obvious behavior)
- ⚠️ Common mistakes (server-specific pitfalls)

## Completions (Autocomplete) - NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Status**: The MCP SDK supports completions but this feature is not currently implemented.

**Alternative**: The MCP SDK auto-generates enum values in the tool schema, so LLMs already see valid action values. For freeform parameters like format codes or color values, document suggestions in tool XML documentation instead.

## Workflow Guidance (SuggestedNextActions & WorkflowHint) - C# IMPLEMENTATION

**Purpose**: Guide LLM workflow after each operation

**IMPLEMENTATION: C# Static Methods** (NOT .md files)

**Why C# instead of .md:**
- Runtime context required (success/failure, batch mode, operation count)
- Conditional logic needed
- Already reusable between CLI and MCP Server

**Implementation**:
- Location: `src/VisioMcp.McpServer/Tools/*Tool.cs`
- Pattern: Ad-hoc JSON properties in tool responses

**When to Add:**
- After CREATE operations: Suggest next steps
- After LIST operations: Suggest actions based on count
- After UPDATE operations: Suggest verification
- After FAILURE: Suggest troubleshooting
- Batch mode hints: "Creating multiple? Use begin_ppt_batch"

## Success Criteria

A good prompt:
- ✅ Lists all valid action values
- ✅ Disambiguates similar actions
- ✅ Explains server-specific quirks
- ✅ Helps choose between tools
- ✅ Under 150 lines
- ❌ Doesn't teach PowerPoint concepts
- ❌ Doesn't show JSON syntax
- ❌ Doesn't duplicate schema info

## Architecture Summary

| Guidance Type | Format | Source of Truth | Status |
|---------------|--------|----------------|--------|
| **Skill Prompts** | Auto-generated from `skills/shared/*.md` | `skills/shared/` | ✅ 16 prompts auto-synced |
| **Completions** | N/A | SDK auto-generates enum values | ❌ Not implemented |
| **Workflow Guidance** | C# static methods | Tool classes | ✅ Keep as C# |

**Sync guarantee:** Claude Desktop (MCP prompts only) and VS Code/Cursor (skills) always get identical guidance because both derive from `skills/shared/*.md`.

**Keep it short. Keep it specific. Keep it server-focused.**
