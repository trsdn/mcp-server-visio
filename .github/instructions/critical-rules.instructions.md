# CRITICAL RULES - MUST FOLLOW

> **⚠️ NON-NEGOTIABLE rules for all VisioMcp development**

## Rule 0: NEVER Commit Without Running Tests (CRITICAL)

**NEVER commit, push, or create PRs without first running tests for the code you changed.**

**Why Critical:** Prevents breaking changes from reaching main, wastes team time debugging failures, violates CI/CD principles.

**Enforcement:**
- ALWAYS run relevant tests BEFORE committing
- Use `--filter "Feature=<feature-name>&RunType!=OnDemand"` for feature-specific tests
- Build must pass (0 warnings, 0 errors)
- Pre-commit hooks must pass (COM leaks, success flag, coverage)
- Document test results in commit message

**Process:**
1. Make code changes
2. Build: `dotnet build` (must succeed with 0 warnings)
3. Run tests: `dotnet test --filter "Feature=<feature>&RunType!=OnDemand"`
4. Verify all tests pass
5. Run pre-commit checks
6. THEN commit

## Rule 21: Never Commit Automatically (CRITICAL)

**NEVER commit or push code automatically. All commits, pushes, and merges must require explicit user approval.**

**Why Critical:** Prevents accidental changes, enforces review, and ensures user control over all repository modifications.

**Enforcement:**
- All automated tools, scripts, and agents must prompt for user approval before any commit, push, or merge.
- No background or silent commits allowed.
- Document this rule in all agent and automation instructions.

## Rule 26: No Confidential Information in Commits/PRs (CRITICAL)

**NEVER include confidential project names, file names, customer names, or internal references in commit messages, PR descriptions, or issue descriptions.**

**Why Critical:** Git history and GitHub issues/PRs are public or semi-public. Confidential information in commits persists forever in git history and is difficult to remove.

**Forbidden in commits/PRs/issues:**
- Customer project names (e.g., "CP Toolkit", "Contoso Deal")
- Specific file paths from customer projects (e.g., "MSX Plan.vsdx", "Milestone_Export")
- Internal tool names that reveal customer context
- Any information that could identify a specific customer engagement

**Allowed:**
- Generic descriptions ("a Visio shape", "a Visio document")
- Technical details that don't identify the source ("a column with a hyphen in the name")
- Error messages and stack traces (sanitized of paths/names)

**Example:**
```
# ❌ WRONG: Reveals confidential project
Discovered while debugging Milestone_Export query in CP Toolkit's MSX Plan.vsdx

# ✅ CORRECT: Generic description
Discovered while debugging a Visio shape that referenced an embedded object
```

**Enforcement:**
- Review all commit messages before pushing
- Review all PR/issue descriptions before submitting
- If confidential info is committed, immediately amend or rebase to remove it


## Quick Reference (Grouped by Context)

**Note:** Rules below are grouped by when you need them, not by number. Detailed rules follow in numeric order below.

**Every Edit:**
| Rule | Action | Why Critical |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 0. Test before commit | ALWAYS run tests before committing | Prevents breaking changes |
| 1. Success flag | NEVER `Success=true` with `ErrorMessage` | Confuses LLMs, causes silent failures |
| 1b. No exception wrapping | Never catch exceptions in Core commands, let batch.Execute() handle | Prevents double-wrapping, preserves stack context |
| 16. Test scope | Only run tests for code you changed | Saves 10+ minutes per test run |
| 8. TODO markers | Must resolve before commit | Pre-commit hook blocks |
| 23. IDE warnings | TRUST them - never dismiss as false positives without verification | Prevents broken code |

**When Writing Code:**
| Rule | Action | Why Critical |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 29. TDD | Write test FIRST → RED → implement → GREEN | Proves tests catch real bugs |
| 30. Integration tests | NEVER write unit tests — integration tests only | Unit tests prove nothing for COM interop |
| 22. COM cleanup | ALWAYS use try-finally, NEVER swallow exceptions | Prevents leaks and silent failures |
| 7. COM API | Use Visio COM first, validate docs | Prevents wrong dependencies |
| 9. GitHub search | Search OTHER repos for VBA/COM examples FIRST | Learn from working code |
| 2. NotImplementedException | Never use, full implementation only | No placeholders allowed |
| 15. Enum mappings | All enum values mapped in ToActionString() | Runtime errors otherwise |
| 17. MCP error checks | Always return JSON, check result.Success | MCP protocol requirement |

**When Writing Tests:**
| Rule | Action | Why Critical |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 2. Tests | Fail loudly, never silent | Silent failures waste hours |
| 30. Integration tests | NEVER write unit tests — integration tests only | Unit tests prove nothing for COM interop |
| 15. No Save | Remove unless testing persistence | Makes tests 50% faster |
| 11. Test debugging | Run tests one by one | Isolates actual failure |
| 13. Test compliance | Pass checklist before PR submission | Prevents test pollution |

**Before Commit:**
| Rule | Action | Time |
|------|--------|------|
| 0. Test before commit | ALWAYS run tests before committing | 3-5 min |
| 4. Session code | See testing-strategy for test commands | 3-5 min |

|------|--------|------|
| 12. No test refs | Production NEVER references tests | Architecture review |
| 5. Instructions | Update after significant work | After major features |

---

## Rule 1: Success Flag Must Match Reality (CRITICAL)

**NEVER set `Success = true` when `ErrorMessage` is set. This is EXTREMELY serious!**

```csharp
// ❌ CRITICAL BUG: Confuses LLMs and users
result.Success = true;
result.ErrorMessage = "Shape added but failed to format...";

// ✅ CORRECT: Success only when NO errors
if (!loadResult.Success) {
    result.Success = false;  // MUST be false!
    result.ErrorMessage = $"Failed: {loadResult.ErrorMessage}";
}
```

**Invariant:** `Success == true` ⟹ `ErrorMessage == null || ErrorMessage == ""`

**Why Critical:** LLMs see Success=true and assume operation worked, causing workflow failures and silent data corruption.

**Common Bug Pattern (43 violations found 2025-01-28):**
```csharp
// ❌ WRONG: Optimistic Success setting without catch block correction
var result = new OperationResult();
result.Success = true;  // Set optimistically

try {
    // ... do work ...
    return result;
} catch (Exception ex) {
    // ❌ BUG: Forgot to set Success = false!
    result.ErrorMessage = $"Error: {ex.Message}";
    return result;  // Returns Success=true with ErrorMessage! 
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Set Success in try block, always false in catch
var result = new OperationResult();

try {
    // ... do work ...
    result.Success = true;  // Only set true on actual success
    return result;
} catch (Exception ex) {
    result.Success = false;  // ✅ Always false in catch!
    result.ErrorMessage = $"Error: {ex.Message}";
    return result;
}
```

**Enforcement:**
- Pre-commit hook runs `check-success-flag.ps1` to detect violations
- Regression tests verify this invariant (SuccessErrorRegressionTests)
- Code review MUST check every `Success = ` assignment
- Search pattern: `Success.*true.*ErrorMessage`

**Examples of bugs found:**
- 43 violations across legacy command examples; modern Visio commands must keep the invariant
- All followed pattern: `Success = true` at start, `ErrorMessage` set in catch without `Success = false`

---

## Rule 1b: Never Suppress Exceptions with Try-Catch (CRITICAL)

**Core Commands: NEVER wrap operations in try-catch blocks that return error results. Let exceptions propagate naturally.**

```csharp
// ❌ CRITICAL BUG: Suppressing exceptions with error result
public async Task<OperationResult> CreateAsync(IVisioBatch batch, string name)
{
    try
    {
        return await batch.Execute((ctx, ct) => {
            dynamic page = ((dynamic)ctx.Document).Pages.Add();
            page.Name = name;
            return ValueTask.FromResult(new OperationResult { Success = true });
        });
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        // ❌ WRONG: Suppresses exception with error result
        return new OperationResult 
        { 
            Success = false, 
            ErrorMessage = ex.Message 
        };
    }
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Let exception propagate to batch.Execute()
public async Task<OperationResult> CreateAsync(IVisioBatch batch, string name)
{
    return await batch.Execute((ctx, ct) => {
        dynamic page = ((dynamic)ctx.Document).Pages.Add();
        page.Name = name;
        return ValueTask.FromResult(new OperationResult { Success = true });
    });
    // batch.Execute() catches via TaskCompletionSource → returns OperationResult { Success = false }
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Finally blocks are allowed for COM resource cleanup
public async Task<OperationResult> ComplexAsync(IVisioBatch batch, dynamic item)
{
    dynamic? temp = null;
    try
    {
        return await batch.Execute((ctx, ct) => {
            temp = CreateItem(item);
            // ... operation ...
            return ValueTask.FromResult(new OperationResult { Success = true });
        });
    }
    finally
    {
        if (temp != null)
        {
            ComUtilities.Release(ref temp!);  // ✅ Finally for cleanup, not error handling
        }
    }
}
```

**Why Critical:**
- `batch.Execute()` ALREADY catches exceptions via `TaskCompletionSource`
- Inner try-catch (method level) causes **double-wrapping** - loses stack context
- Exceptions become `OperationResult { Success = false, ErrorMessage }` from batch layer (correct layer)
- Finally blocks are CORRECT for resource cleanup, NOT catch blocks for error suppression
- Pattern removed from 200+ methods across all command layers in Nov 2025

**Safe Patterns (Keep these):**
- ✅ Loop continuations: `catch { continue; }`
- ✅ Optional property access: `catch { propValue = null; }`
- ✅ Specific error routing: `catch (COMException ex) when (ex.HResult == code) { handle... }`
- ✅ Finally blocks: Resource cleanup for COM objects

**Pattern to Remove:**
- ❌ `catch (Exception ex) { return new Result { Success = false, ErrorMessage = ex.Message }; }`

**Architecture Foundation:**
```
Core Command Method (NO try-catch wrapping)
  └─> await batch.Execute()
      └─> TaskCompletionSource catches exceptions
          └─> Returns OperationResult { Success = false, ErrorMessage }
```

**See:** architecture-patterns.instructions.md for complete exception propagation pattern and examples.

---

## Rule 2: No NotImplementedException

**Every feature must be fully implemented with real Visio COM operations and passing tests. No placeholders.**

---

## Rule 3: Session Cleanup Tests

**When modifying session/batch code, run OnDemand tests (see testing-strategy.instructions.md). Must pass before commit.**

---

## Rule 4: Update Instructions

**After significant work, update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with lessons learned, architecture changes, and testing insights.**

---

## Rule 5: COM Object Leak Detection

**Before commit: `& "scripts\check-com-leaks.ps1"` must report 0 leaks.**

All `dynamic` COM objects must be released in `finally` blocks using `ComUtilities.Release(ref obj!)`.

Exception: Session management files (VisioBatch.cs, VisioSession.cs).

---

## Rule 6: All Changes Via Pull Requests

**Never commit to `main`. Create feature branch → PR → CI/CD + review → merge.**

**Enforcement:** Pre-commit hook blocks commits to main. If you're on main:
```powershell
git stash                                    # Save changes
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name    # Create feature branch
git stash pop                                # Restore changes
git add <files>                              # Stage changes
git commit -m "your message"                 # Commit to feature branch
```

**Why Critical:** Direct commits to main bypass CI/CD, skip code review, and violate branch protection.

---

## Rule 7: COM API First

**Use Visio COM API for everything it supports. Only use external libraries (TOM) for features Visio COM doesn't provide.**

Validate against [Microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/vba/api/overview/visio) before adding dependencies.

---

## Rule 8: No TODO/FIXME Markers

**Code must be complete before commit. No TODO, FIXME, HACK, or XXX markers in source code.**

Delete commented-out code (use git history). Exception: Documentation files only.

---

## Rule 9: Search External GitHub Repositories for Working Examples First

**BEFORE creating new Visio COM Interop code or troubleshooting COM issues:**

- **ALWAYS** search OTHER open source GitHub repositories for working examples
- **NEVER** search your own repository - only search external projects
- **NetOffice is THE BEST source for ALL COM Interop work**: https://github.com/NetOfficeFw/NetOffice
  - Strongly-typed C# wrappers for ALL Office COM APIs (Excel, Word, Visio, Outlook, etc.)
  - Search for ANY Visio COM operation: pages, shapes, stencils, ShapeSheet cells, connectors, formatting, etc.
  - Study their patterns for dynamic interop conversion and proper COM object handling
  - NetOffice source code is essentially a comprehensive reference for every Visio COM API
- Look for repositories with Visio automation, VBA code, or Office interop projects
- Search for the specific COM object/method you need (e.g., "Page DrawRectangle VBA", "Shape CellsU VBA", "Document Pages NetOffice")
- Study proven patterns from other projects before writing new code
- Avoid reinventing solutions - learn from working implementations in the wild

**Why:** Visio COM is quirky. Real-world VBA examples from other projects prevent common pitfalls (1-based indexing, object cleanup, async issues, variant types, etc.)

---

## Rule 10: Debug Tests One by One

**When debugging test failures, ALWAYS run tests individually - never run all tests at once.**

**Process:**
1. List all test methods in the file
2. Run each test individually using `--filter "FullyQualifiedName=Namespace.Class.Method"`
3. Identify exact failure for each test before moving to next
4. Fix issues one test at a time

**Why:** Running all tests together masks which specific test fails and why. Individual execution provides clear, isolated diagnostics.

---

## Rule 11: Production Code NEVER References Tests

**Production code (Core, CLI, MCP Server) must NEVER reference test projects or test helpers.**

**Violations:**
- ❌ `<InternalsVisibleTo Include="*.Tests" />` in production `.csproj`
- ❌ `using VisioMcp.*.Tests` in production code
- ❌ Production code calling test helper methods
- ❌ Production business logic in helper classes that tests use

**Correct Architecture:**
- ✅ **COM utilities** → `ComInterop/ComUtilities.cs` (low-level COM helpers like SafeGetString, ForEach iterators)
- ✅ **Business logic** → Private methods inside production Commands classes
- ✅ **Test helpers** → Call production commands, never duplicate logic
- ✅ `InternalsVisibleTo` only for production-to-production (e.g., Core → MCP Server)

**Why:** Tests depend on production code, not the reverse. Production code with test dependencies is broken architecture.

---

## Rule 12: Test Class Compliance Checklist

**Every new test class MUST pass the compliance checklist before PR submission.**

**Verify:**
- ✅ Uses `IClassFixture<TempDirectoryFixture>` (NOT manual IDisposable)
- ✅ Each test creates unique file via `CoreTestHelper.CreateUniqueTestFile()`
- ✅ NEVER shares test files between tests
- ✅ VBA tests use `.vsdm` extension (NOT .vsdx renamed)
- ✅ Binary assertions only (NO "accept both" patterns)
- ✅ All required traits present (Category, Speed, Layer, RequiresVisio, Feature)
- ✅ Batch API pattern used correctly (no ValueTask.FromResult wrapper)
- ✅ NO duplicate helper methods (use CoreTestHelper)

**Why:** Systematic compliance prevents test pollution, file lock issues, silent failures, and maintenance nightmares. See [testing-strategy.instructions.md](testing-strategy.instructions.md) for complete checklist.

**Enforcement:** PR reviewers MUST check compliance before approval.

---

## Rule 13: Comprehensive Bug Fixes

**Every bug fix MUST include all 6 components before PR submission.**

**Required Components:**
1. ✅ **Code Fix** - Minimal surgical changes to fix root cause
2. ✅ **Tests** - Minimum 5-8 new tests (regression + edge cases + backwards compat)
3. ✅ **Documentation** - Update 3+ files (tool docs, user docs, prompts)
4. ✅ **Workflow Hints** - Update SuggestedNextActions and error messages
5. ✅ **Quality Verification** - Build passes, all tests green, 0 warnings
6. ✅ **PR Description** - Comprehensive summary (bug report, fix, tests, docs updated)

**Process:** Follow [bug-fixing-checklist.instructions.md](bug-fixing-checklist.instructions.md) for complete 6-step process.

**Why:** Incomplete bug fixes lead to regressions, confusion, and wasted time. Comprehensive fixes prevent future issues.

**Example:** Shape rotation + positioning bug = 1 code file + 13 tests + 5 doc files + detailed PR description = complete fix.

---

## Rule 14: No Save Unless Testing Persistence

**Code must NOT call `batch.Save()` unless explicitly testing persistence.**

**Quick Rules:**
- ❌ FORBIDDEN: Tests only verifying operation success or in-memory state
- ✅ REQUIRED: Round-trip tests verifying data persists after document close/reopen
- ⚡ REASON: Save is slow (~2-5s). Removing unnecessary saves makes tests 50%+ faster

**See:** [testing-strategy.instructions.md](testing-strategy.instructions.md) for complete Save patterns, when to use, and detailed examples.

---

## Rule 15: Complete Enum Mappings (CRITICAL)

**Every enum value MUST have a mapping in ToActionString(). Missing mappings cause unhandled exceptions.**

```csharp
// ❌ WRONG: Incomplete mapping
public static string ToActionString(this RangeAction action) => action switch
{
    RangeAction.GetValues => "get-values",
    RangeAction.SetValues => "set-values",
    // Missing GetUsedRange, GetCurrentRegion, etc. → ArgumentException!
    _ => throw new ArgumentException($"Unknown RangeAction: {action}")
};

// ✅ CORRECT: All enum values mapped
public static string ToActionString(this RangeAction action) => action switch
{
    RangeAction.GetValues => "get-values",
    RangeAction.SetValues => "set-values",
    RangeAction.GetUsedRange => "get-used-range",  // ✅ All values
    RangeAction.GetCurrentRegion => "get-current-region",
    // ... all other values
    _ => throw new ArgumentException($"Unknown RangeAction: {action}")
};
```

**Why Critical:** Missing mappings cause MCP Server to throw exceptions instead of returning JSON, confusing LLMs.

**Enforcement:**
- Regression tests for all enum mappings
- When adding enum value, add mapping immediately
- Code review MUST verify completeness

**Example Bug:** `GetUsedRange` missing → "An error occurred invoking 'range'" (not JSON!)

---

## Rule 16: Test Only What You Changed (CRITICAL - PERFORMANCE)

**ALWAYS run tests ONLY for the specific code you modified. Integration tests take a very long time.**

**Wrong:**
```powershell
# ❌ NEVER: Runs ALL integration tests (10+ minutes)
dotnet test --filter "Category=Integration&RunType!=OnDemand"
```

**Correct:**
```powershell
# ✅ CORRECT: Test only the feature you changed
dotnet test --filter "Feature=Page&RunType!=OnDemand"        # Page changes only
dotnet test --filter "Feature=Shape&RunType!=OnDemand"      # Shape changes only
dotnet test --filter "Feature=Text&RunType!=OnDemand"       # Text changes only
```

**Why Critical:** Integration tests require Visio COM automation and are SLOW. Running all tests wastes time and resources.

**Enforcement:**
- Only run tests for files you modified
- Use Feature trait to target specific test groups
- Full test suite runs in CI/CD pipeline only

---

## Rule 17: MCP Tools Must Return JSON Responses (CORRECTED)

**Every MCP tool method that calls Core Commands MUST return JSON responses, not throw exceptions for business errors.**

```csharp
// ❌ WRONG: Throws exception for business logic errors
private static async Task<string> SomeAction(...)
{
    var result = await commands.SomeAsync(batch, param);
    
    if (!result.Success && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(result.ErrorMessage))
    {
        throw new ModelContextProtocol.McpException($"action failed: {result.ErrorMessage}");  // ❌ Wrong!
    }
    
    return JsonSerializer.Serialize(result, JsonOptions);
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Always return JSON - let result.Success indicate errors
private static async Task<string> SomeAction(...)
{
    var result = await commands.SomeAsync(batch, param);
    
    // Always return JSON (success or failure) - MCP clients handle the success flag
    return JsonSerializer.Serialize(result, JsonOptions);
}
```

**When to Throw McpException:**
- ✅ **Parameter validation** - missing required params, invalid formats
- ✅ **Pre-conditions** - file not found, batch not found, invalid state
- ❌ **NOT for business logic errors** - table not found, query failed, etc.

**Why:**
- ✅ MCP clients expect JSON responses with `success: false` for business errors
- ✅ HTTP 200 + JSON error = client can parse and handle gracefully
- ❌ HTTP 500 + exception = harder for clients to handle programmatically
- ✅ Core Commands return result objects with `Success` flag - serialize them!

**Example - Business Error (return JSON):**
```csharp
// Core returns: { Success = false, ErrorMessage = "Shape 'Title' not found" }
// MCP Tool: Return this as-is
return JsonSerializer.Serialize(result, JsonOptions);
// Client gets: {"success": false, "errorMessage": "Shape 'Title' not found"}
```

**Example - Validation Error (throw exception):**
```csharp
// Missing required parameter
if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(tableName))
{
    throw new ModelContextProtocol.McpException("tableName is required for create-from-table action");
}
```

**Historical Note:** This rule was corrected on 2025-01-03 after discovering that tests expected JSON responses, not exceptions. The previous pattern (throwing McpException for business errors) was incorrect and caused MCP clients to receive unhandled errors instead of parseable JSON.

---

## Rule 18: Tool Descriptions Must Match Behavior (CRITICAL)

**Tool XML documentation (`/// <summary>`) is extracted by MCP SDK and sent to LLMs. It must be accurate and current.**

**What to verify when changing a tool:**

1. **Purpose and Use Cases Clear**:
   ```csharp
   // ❌ WRONG: Vague description
   /// <summary>Manage pages</summary>
   
   // ✅ CORRECT: Clear purpose and use cases
   /// <summary>
   /// Manage Visio page lifecycle: create, read, rename, delete, and configure pages.
   /// </summary>
   ```

2. **Non-Enum Parameter Values Documented**:
   ```csharp
   // ❌ WRONG: Parameter values not explained
   /// <summary>Add shape with shapeType parameter</summary>
   
   // ✅ CORRECT: Non-enum parameter values explained
   /// <summary>
   /// Add shape to a Visio page.
   /// 
   /// SHAPE TYPES:
   /// - 'rectangle': Add rectangle shape (DEFAULT)
   /// - 'oval': Add oval shape
   /// - 'textbox': Add text box
   /// - 'line': Add line shape
   /// </summary>
   ```

3. **Server-Specific Behavior Documented**:
   ```csharp
   // ❌ WRONG: Behavior changed but description outdated
   /// <summary>Default: shapeType='line'</summary>  // Wrong!
   
   // ✅ CORRECT: Description reflects actual default
   /// <summary>Default: shapeType='rectangle'</summary>
   ```

**What NOT to include:**
- ❌ **Enum action lists** - MCP SDK auto-generates these in schema (LLMs see them via dropdown)
- ❌ **Parameter types** - Schema provides this
- ❌ **Required/optional flags** - Schema provides this

**Why Critical:** LLMs use tool descriptions for server-specific guidance. Inaccurate descriptions cause:
- Wrong default parameter values
- Incorrect workflow assumptions
- Confused users when behavior doesn't match docs

**When to Update:**
- Changing default values or server behavior
- Adding/changing non-enum parameter values (shapeType, export format, cell name, etc.)
- Changing which tools to use for related operations
- Adding performance guidance (batch mode)

**See:** [mcp-server-guide.instructions.md](mcp-server-guide.instructions.md) for complete Tool Description checklist.

---

## Rule 19: Check PR Review Comments After Creating PR (CRITICAL)

**After creating a PR, ALWAYS check for automated review comments from Copilot and GitHub Advanced Security.**

```powershell
# Retrieve inline code review comments using GitHub CLI
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: gh CLI requires authentication with a PERSONAL GitHub account.
# Enterprise Managed User (EMU) accounts cannot access public repos via gh CLI.
# Use: gh auth login --with-token (with a personal access token)
gh api repos/trsdn/mcp-server-visio/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/comments --paginate

# Or use the mcp_github tool if available
mcp_github_github_pull_request_read(method="get_review_comments", owner="trsdn", repo="mcp-server-visio", pullNumber=PULL_NUMBER)
```

**Common automated reviewers:**
- **Copilot** (code quality, performance, style)
- **github-advanced-security** (security scanning, code analysis)

**Common issues to fix:**
- Improper `/// <inheritdoc/>` on constructors/test methods that don't override
- `.AsSpan().ToString()` inefficiency - use `[..n]` range operator instead
- Nullable type access without null checks
- `foreach` → `.Select()` for functional style
- Nested if statements that can be combined
- Generic catch clauses - use specific exceptions or add justification
- Path.Combine security warnings - suppress with justification for test code

**Fix all automated review comments before requesting human review.**

**Why Critical:** Automated reviewers catch common code quality issues early. Fixing them promptly:
- Improves code quality and maintainability
- Reduces human reviewer workload
- Speeds up PR approval process
- Prevents accumulation of technical debt

**Process:**
1. Create PR
2. Immediately check for review comments (within 1-2 minutes)
3. Fix all automated issues in a single follow-up commit
4. Push fixes to PR branch
5. Request human review only after all automated issues resolved

## Rule 22: COM Cleanup Must Use Finally Blocks (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS use try-finally for COM object cleanup. NEVER swallow exceptions with empty catch blocks.**

```csharp
// ❌ WRONG: Swallows exception, sets fallback value
try
{
    dynamic page = ((dynamic)ctx.Document).Pages.Item(1);
    dynamic shape = page.Shapes.Item(1);
    name = shape.Name?.ToString() ?? string.Empty;
    ComUtilities.Release(ref shape!);  // Won't execute if exception occurs!
    ComUtilities.Release(ref page!);
}
catch
{
    name = "(unknown)";  // Swallows exception!
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Finally ensures cleanup, exceptions propagate
dynamic? page = null;
dynamic? shape = null;
try
{
    page = ((dynamic)ctx.Document).Pages.Item(1);
    shape = page.Shapes.Item(1);
    name = shape.Name?.ToString() ?? string.Empty;
}
finally
{
    if (shape != null) ComUtilities.Release(ref shape!);
    if (page != null) ComUtilities.Release(ref page!);
}
// Exception propagates naturally, COM objects always released
```

**Why Critical:**
- Finally blocks execute **regardless** of exceptions
- COM objects leak if Release() not reached before exception
- Swallowing exceptions hides real problems
- Empty catch blocks are code smell - remove them
- Let exceptions propagate naturally to batch.Execute()

**Pattern Requirements:**
1. Declare COM objects as `dynamic?` nullable before try block
2. Initialize to `null`
3. Acquire COM objects in try block
4. Release in finally block with null checks
5. **NO catch blocks** unless specific exception handling needed
6. **NEVER** catch just to set fallback values like "(unknown)"

## Rule 23: NEVER Dismiss IDE/Linter Warnings as False Positives (CRITICAL)

**When VS Code, linters, or other tooling shows errors or warnings, TRUST THEM. Do not dismiss them as "false positives" without verification.**

**Why Critical:** Dismissing valid warnings leads to broken code reaching production. The agent's job is to write correct code, not rationalize why incorrect code is acceptable.

```yaml
# ❌ WRONG: Agent dismissed YAML error as "false positive"
run: |
  $notes = @"
  ## Release Notes
  ```powershell
  code here
  ```
  "@
# VS Code showed: "Unexpected scalar at node end" - THIS WAS A REAL ERROR

# ✅ CORRECT: Agent should have tested or researched before dismissing
# PowerShell here-strings (@"..."@) don't work in GitHub Actions YAML
# Use string concatenation instead:
run: |
  $notes = "## Release Notes`n"
  $notes += '```powershell' + "`n"
  $notes += "code here`n"
  $notes += '```'
```

**Enforcement:**
- If IDE shows error/warning, assume it's CORRECT until proven otherwise
- To disprove a warning, you MUST either:
  1. Run the code and verify it works, OR
  2. Find authoritative documentation proving the warning is wrong
- "I think it will work" is NOT verification
- "The linter is confused" is NOT a valid dismissal

**Common False Positive Claims That Are Usually WRONG:**
- "YAML linter doesn't understand multi-line strings" - It usually does
- "PowerShell syntax is valid, YAML just can't parse it" - If YAML can't parse it, the workflow fails
- "This works locally" - GitHub Actions environment may differ

**What To Do Instead:**
1. See a warning → Pause and investigate
2. Research the specific syntax/pattern
3. Test if possible (run workflow, run code locally)
4. If warning is truly false positive, document WHY with evidence
5. If uncertain, use a simpler approach that doesn't trigger warnings

## Rule 24: Post-Change Sync Verification (CRITICAL)

**After adding or modifying any tool/action, ALWAYS verify ALL sync points are updated. This is MANDATORY before commit.**

**Sync Points Checklist:**

When adding a NEW action to an existing tool:
| Sync Point | Files to Update |
|------------|-----------------|
| 1. Enum | `ToolActions.cs` - Add enum value |
| 2. Mapping | `ActionExtensions.cs` - Add ToActionString() case |
| 3. Interface | `I*Commands.cs` - Add interface method |
| 4. Core | `*Commands.*.cs` - Implement method |
| 5. MCP Server | `Visio*Tool.cs` - Add switch case + handler |
| 6. CLI Daemon | Visio CLI routing / generated command registration - add switch/handler if not generated |
| 7. Feature Count | `FEATURES.md` - Update operation count |
| 8. README Files | All READMEs with operation counts (main, MCP, CLI, mcpb, vscode) |
| 9. Skills Docs | `skills/shared/visio_*.md` - Document new action |

**Quick Check Commands:**
```powershell
# Find all files with operation counts
Select-String -Path **\*.md -Pattern "101 generated actions|11 tools"

# Verify enum/mapping consistency
# Count enum values vs switch cases in CLI and MCP
```

**Why Critical:** 
- MCP tool without CLI = broken parity (agents confused by inconsistent behavior)
- Outdated READMEs = user confusion about capabilities
- Skills docs out of sync = LLMs give wrong instructions

**When to Run This Checklist:**
- After adding ANY new action to ANY tool
- After adding ANY new tool
- After removing/deprecating actions
- Before EVERY commit that touches tool/action code

**Historical Example (Jan 2026):**
A new page action was added to:
- ✅ ToolActions.cs enum
- ✅ ActionExtensions.cs mapping
- ✅ IPageCommands.cs interface
- ✅ PageCommands.cs implementation
- ✅ VisioPageTool.cs MCP handler
- ❌ CLI routing / generated command registration (MISSED!)
- ❌ FEATURES.md count (MISSED!)
- ❌ README files (MISSED!)

Result: Caught during commit review, required additional fixes.

## Rule 25: Use PowerShell Syntax in Documentation (CRITICAL)

**VisioMcp is Windows-only. ALL documentation code blocks MUST use PowerShell syntax, NOT bash.**

```markdown
# ❌ WRONG: bash syntax
```powershell
dotnet build
visiocli sheet list --file "test.vsdx"
```

# ✅ CORRECT: PowerShell syntax
```powershell
dotnet build
visiocli sheet list --file "test.vsdx"
```
```

**Why Critical:**
- VisioMcp requires Windows + Visio COM interop
- bash syntax confuses Windows users
- PowerShell is the native Windows shell
- Syntax highlighting differs between bash/powershell

**Enforcement:**
- Use `powershell` or `pwsh` code fence, NEVER `bash` or `sh`
- Exception: Docker/Linux-specific docs (e.g., GitHub Actions runners on Linux)
- Review all new .md files for bash code blocks before commit

**Quick Check:**
```powershell
# Find all bash code blocks in markdown files
Select-String -Path "**/*.md" -Pattern '```powershell' -Recurse
```

---

## Rule 27: Update CHANGELOG Before Merging PRs (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS update CHANGELOG.md before merging any PR that adds features, fixes bugs, or makes breaking changes.**

**Why Critical:** 
- Users and LLMs rely on CHANGELOG to understand what changed
- Release workflow extracts version notes from CHANGELOG
- Missing entries make releases incomplete and confusing
- Git history is not a substitute for curated change documentation

**What Requires CHANGELOG Entry:**
- ✅ Bug fixes (with issue number)
- ✅ New features or actions
- ✅ Breaking changes
- ✅ Significant behavior changes
- ✅ New pre-commit checks or tooling
- ❌ Internal refactoring (no user-visible change)
- ❌ Documentation-only changes (unless significant)
- ❌ Test-only changes

**Format (Keep a Changelog):**
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Feature Name** (#issue): Brief description

### Fixed
- **Bug Title** (#issue): Brief description
  - ROOT CAUSE: What caused it
  - FIX: How it was fixed

### Changed
- **Change Title**: Brief description
```

**Process:**
1. Before merging PR, check if changes need CHANGELOG entry
2. Add entry under `## [Unreleased]` section
3. Use appropriate category: Added, Fixed, Changed, Removed, Security
4. Include issue/PR number for traceability
5. Commit CHANGELOG update with the PR or as final commit before merge

**Enforcement:**
- Review CHANGELOG.md before every PR merge
- Agent must ask: "Does this change need a CHANGELOG entry?"
- Merging without CHANGELOG update for user-visible changes = bug

## Rule 28: COM API Parameter Naming (CRITICAL)

**When naming parameters on COM API wrapper methods, apply this nuanced principle:**

> **If the COM method's parameter name is clear and self-describing in our flat tool schema, use it.
> If the COM name is opaque or ambiguous without its parent context, keep a more descriptive name.**

**Why:** MCP tool parameters appear in a flat schema — they lose the context of the parent class/method. A name that works when you see `Shape.Rotation` may be opaque when the LLM just sees a `rotation` parameter. Conversely, inventing a name like `rotationAngle` when COM already calls it `Rotation` adds unnecessary indirection.

**Decision Framework:**

| COM API | COM Param | Our Param | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| `Pages.Item(Index)` | `Index` | `pageIndex` | ✅ Keep descriptive — `index` alone is ambiguous |
| `Shape.CellsU("Angle")` | `Angle` | `angleFormula` | ✅ `rotation` is self-describing in tool schema |
| `Shape.Name` | `Name` | `shapeName` | ✅ Keep descriptive — COM's `Name` property is too generic in flat schema |
| `Shape.Text` | (property) | `text` | ✅ Clear in context |
| `Shapes.Item(Index)` | `Index` | `pageIndex` | ✅ Keep descriptive — `index` alone is ambiguous |

**Implementation Pattern:**
```csharp
// ✅ COM name is clear → use it directly
void SetAngle(IVisioBatch batch, string shapeName, string angleFormula, ...);

// ✅ COM name works in flat schema → use it
OperationResult SetText(IVisioBatch batch, int pageIndex, string shapeName, string text);

// ✅ COM name too generic → keep descriptive
void DrawRectangle(IVisioBatch batch, int pageIndex, string shapeName, double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2);
```

**When Adding New Parameters:**
1. Check the COM API docs for the original parameter name
2. Ask: "Would an LLM understand `{com_param_name}` without seeing the method/class name?"
3. If YES → use COM name (e.g., `text`, `left`, `cellName`)
4. If NO → use descriptive name (e.g., `shapeName` not `Name`, `pageIndex` not `Index`)

## Rule 29: Test-Driven Development (TDD) (CRITICAL)

**Write the test FIRST. Watch it FAIL. Then implement. Then watch it PASS.**

This is non-negotiable for all new features and bug fixes. The workflow is:

1. **Write a failing test** that describes the expected behavior
2. **Run the test** — it MUST fail (red)
3. **Implement the minimum code** to make the test pass
4. **Run the test again** — it MUST pass (green)
5. **Refactor** if needed, ensuring tests still pass

```csharp
// Step 1: Write the test FIRST (before any implementation)
[Fact]
[Trait("Feature", "Progress")]
public void ProgressAdapter_Maps_Current_To_Progress()
{
    // This test describes what the code SHOULD do
    // It will FAIL because the class doesn't exist yet
    var reported = new List<ProgressNotificationValue>();
    IProgress<ProgressNotificationValue> inner = new Progress<ProgressNotificationValue>(v => reported.Add(v));
    var adapter = new McpProgressAdapter(inner);

    adapter.Report(new ProgressInfo { Current = 0.5f, Total = 1.0f, Message = "Half done" });

    Assert.Single(reported);
    Assert.Equal(0.5f, reported[0].Progress);
}

// Step 2: Run → RED (McpProgressAdapter doesn't exist)
// Step 3: Implement McpProgressAdapter
// Step 4: Run → GREEN
// Step 5: Refactor if needed
```

**Why Critical:**
- **Proves the test actually tests something** — a test that never fails never caught a bug
- **Defines behavior before implementation** — forces clear thinking about requirements
- **Prevents "tests that always pass"** — if your test passes before implementation, it's testing nothing
- **Catches regressions immediately** — the test existed before the code, so it's a true regression guard
- **Reduces debugging time** — small red→green cycles isolate problems instantly

**Common Violations:**
```
# ❌ WRONG: Write code first, then write tests that pass
1. Implement feature     ← No test to guide you
2. Write tests           ← Tests shaped to match implementation, not requirements
3. Tests pass            ← Of course they do — you wrote them to match existing code

# ✅ CORRECT: TDD cycle
1. Write failing test    ← Defines what "correct" means
2. Run test → RED        ← Proves the test catches the missing behavior
3. Implement feature     ← Guided by the test
4. Run test → GREEN      ← Proves the implementation is correct
```

**Enforcement:**
- When adding a new feature: write tests FIRST, commit them separately if needed
- When fixing a bug: write a test that reproduces the bug FIRST, then fix
- In PR reviews: verify that tests were written before or alongside implementation
- If a test passes on the first run without any implementation changes, investigate — it may be testing nothing

**Applies To:**
- All new Core Commands methods
- All new MCP Server tool actions
- All bug fixes (regression test first)
- All CLI command additions

**Exception:** Pure refactoring where existing tests already cover the behavior — no new tests needed, but existing tests must still pass.

---

## Rule 30: Integration Tests Over Unit Tests (CRITICAL)

**NEVER write unit tests. Unit tests that mock COM objects, fake contexts, or test adapter mappings in isolation prove NOTHING. Write integration tests that exercise real Visio COM automation.**

**Why Critical:** VisioMcp is a COM interop project. The bugs that matter — STA threading deadlocks, COM object leaks, OleMessageFilter re-entrancy, type conversion failures (`double` vs `int`), shape persistence — **only manifest when real Visio is running**. A unit test that verifies an adapter maps field A to field B catches zero real bugs. An integration test that opens a Visio document, adds a shape, and verifies the result catches ALL of them.

```csharp
// ❌ WRONG: Unit test that proves nothing
[Fact]
[Trait("Category", "Unit")]
public void Adapter_Maps_Field_A_To_Field_B()
{
    var adapter = new SomeAdapter(mockProgress);
    adapter.Report(new Info { Current = 0.5f });
    Assert.Equal(0.5f, captured.Progress);  // So what? This never fails in production.
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Integration test that catches real bugs
[Fact]
[Trait("Category", "Integration")]
[Trait("Feature", "Shape")]
public void AddShape_ReportsProgress_DuringExecution()
{
    using var batch = VisioSession.BeginBatch(_testFile);
    var progress = new List<ProgressInfo>();
    var result = _commands.AddShape(batch, 1, "Rectangle",
        new Progress<ProgressInfo>(p => progress.Add(p)));
    Assert.True(result.Success);
    Assert.NotEmpty(progress);  // Real Visio, real shape creation, real progress
}
```

**What Counts as Integration:**
- ✅ Opens a real Visio document via COM
- ✅ Exercises real batch.Execute() on STA thread
- ✅ Verifies real data flows through the full pipeline
- ✅ Catches COM threading, type conversion, and persistence bugs

**What Does NOT Count:**
- ❌ Mocking IProgress, IVisioBatch, or any COM interface
- ❌ Testing adapter/mapper classes in isolation
- ❌ Verifying AsyncLocal behavior without COM context
- ❌ Any test that passes without Visio.exe running

**Enforcement:**
- Code review MUST reject unit tests for COM-dependent features
- All new tests MUST have `[Trait("Category", "Integration")]`
- If a test doesn't require Visio, question whether it tests anything meaningful
- The only acceptable non-integration tests are for pure algorithmic utilities with zero COM dependency (e.g., string parsing, enum mapping validation)

**Historical Lesson:** 10 unit tests were written for the MCP progress feature (McpProgressAdapter mapping, ProgressContext AsyncLocal). All 10 passed. Zero of them would have caught the real bugs: STA thread affinity issues, COM callback re-entrancy during shape operations, or progress notifications not flowing through the generated code pipeline. The unit tests tested the unit tests.
